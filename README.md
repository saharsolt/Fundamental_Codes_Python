# Fundamental_Codes_Python

These are the codes I wrote while learning the fundamentals of Python, a programming language. After each chapter, some projects are defined for trainees to estimate how well they learn. For finishing the course, they define a final project in which there are names and hashes of their password in the csv input file. We must write a code to read from it and use sha256 as hashing and write the name and password of each person in a file(Rainbow).
